## 🎯 Project Goal

The main goal of this project was to develop a **single-page application (SPA)** that allows users to search for vegetarian recipes using the **Spoonacular API**.  
The focus was on creating a **responsive and easy-to-use interface**, managing the display of results and recipe details effectively.

The core development focused on **React**, **Axios** for API calls, and **Context API** for state management.  
Attention was paid to creating a **responsive layout**, handling dynamic recipe data, and providing clear user feedback (loading states, error messages).
